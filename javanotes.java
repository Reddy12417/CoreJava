- From Java 11 onwards JRE is removed from java software, only JDK.
- Setting path is for binary files ( /bin foler ).
- Setting classpath is for library files ( /lib foler ).
- Setting JAVA_HOME is for tomcat ( JDK folder ).
- Setting temporary path "set path= C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-15\bin;%path%"
- In Java 15 , the path is auto set when we install the software.
